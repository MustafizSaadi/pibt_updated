PIBT
===
Let multiple agents move smoothly.
See [the project page](https://kei18.github.io/pibt).

__IMPORTANT NOTES__
- In v1.0-v1.2, the PPS implementation includes bugs. Use the latest (â‰¥v1.3).
You can check the PPS results [here](/others/pps-latest-result.md).
The results are not so different from the PIBT paper.
- PIBT and other solvers (W/HCA*, E/CBS) have [a new implementation](https://kei18.github.io/mapf-IR).
  The new one is much cleaner.
  *I strongly recommend using the new one instead of this repo.*

## Demo

## Requirement
The visualization relies on [openFrameworks](https://openframeworks.cc).
You need to install openFrameworks beforehand and export `OF_ROOT` of your environment.
```
export OF_ROOT={your openFrameworks directory}
```

The latest implementation relies on [boost](https://www.boost.org/).

## Usage
At first, you must prepare param file.
To confirm details, see [a sample file](sample-param.txt).
Then you can execute the simulator as following.

- implementation with openFrameworks
```
make of
make ofrun param=sample-param.txt
```

- without visualization (for experiment)
```
make c
make crun param=sample-param.txt
```
